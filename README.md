### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hello there, everyone. My name is Sean and I don't really know what I am doing here. I am a slowly-aging liberal punk rocker from Southern California. I am a technology enthusiast and hobbyist with a strong interest in learning about and how to code (even though I kinda suck at it). Welp. That's all I got for right now. Thanks for sticking around. :-)
